# BigMac - Jacob Burton

## How to run

**npm run bigmac** -
This will start up both your Front End React App **(3000)** && your Node back end server **(8080)**, locally

## Swagger

View the swagger file once application is runnong at **http://localhost:8080/api-docs/**

## Logic Information

In the provided BigMac CSV data set, each country has multiple dates which reflect the currency/price information at that corresponding date.
So when I went to process all the calculations for this application, I chose a random date for both the **Local Country** and **Random Country**
I display which date the calucations are reffering to at the top of the page

## Issues with **ipvigilante.com**

When I was finishing up the applicaiton, I started having trouble connecting with **(https://ipvigilante.com/json/)**
Even when navigating to **https://ipvigilante.com/json/8.8.8.8** from their developer docs on chrome, I get **This site canâ€™t be reachedipvigilante.com refused to connect.**
